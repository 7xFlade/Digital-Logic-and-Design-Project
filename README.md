This is the repository of my project for my Digital Logic and Design course. The name of the project is Super Mario Jumper which has been made in Vivado using Verilog, and utilises an Infra-Red sensor as an input using a Basys 3 FPGA board.
The original project can be seen here https://github.com/howardlau1999/flapga-mario, and we implemented an IR sensor into it which makes Mario jump at a high signal and then he glides like he does at the low signal, fixed some bugs and overall customised it to our preferences.
